# Play Store App Review Analysis

## Project Summary
This project involves an in-depth analysis of Google Play Store apps and reviews to derive meaningful insights about the Android app market. Using Python, we explore over 10,000 apps from Google Play across various categories. The primary goal is to understand trends, user sentiments, and strategies for driving app growth and retention.

## Dataset Description
The project utilizes two datasets:

1. **`playstore_data.csv`**:
   - Contains details of apps on Google Play.
   - Includes 13 features describing each app, such as name, category, rating, and more.

2. **`user_reviews.csv`**:
   - Contains up to 100 reviews for each app, sorted by relevance.
   - Includes processed text reviews with attributes like:
     - **Sentiment**: Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
     - **Sentiment Polarity**: Numerical representation of sentiment strength.
     - **Sentiment Subjectivity**: Level of subjectivity in the review.

## Features
- **Type**: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Regression, Classification, and Unsupervised Learning.
- **Contributor**: Sakshi Pande (Individual Project).

## Objectives
- Analyze app characteristics to identify trends across categories.
- Understand user sentiments and their impact on app ratings.
- Explore relationships between app features and their success metrics.
- Provide actionable insights for developers and marketers to improve app performance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize columns for consistent analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize trends across app categories.
   - Investigate correlations between features like price, rating, and reviews.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Analyze review sentiments using polarity and subjectivity metrics.
   - Identify patterns in user feedback.

4. **Machine Learning (if applicable)**:
   - Regression models to predict ratings or downloads.
   - Classification models for sentiment prediction.

5. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Summarize key findings for app developers and marketers.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - Data manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Text analysis: NLTK, TextBlob
  - Machine learning: scikit-learn
